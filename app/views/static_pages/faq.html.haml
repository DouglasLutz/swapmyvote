		%h1 FAQ

		%a{name: "legal"}
		%h2 Is this legal?
		%p Vote swapping has taken place informally since voting began, not least within parliaments. We know of no law against it (unlike selling your vote, or compelling someone to vote against their will, which are very much illegal!), and indeed in The USA vote swapping was found by the Supreme Court to be protected speech under the First Amendment. Swapmyvote.uk merely introduces two individuals to each other who have the relevant voting preferences; nothing changes hands and the secret ballot still stands: you are responsible for trusting your partner - and voting according to your conscience!

		%h2 Who are we?
		%p
			We are a loose knit group of people who care passionately about making democracy work better, and believe that new technologies (the Internet, social media, etc) can very much play their part in this.

		%h2 How do I know my partner will vote (for who I want)?
		%p We have integrated the swapmyvote.uk platform with the main social networks used in the UK so that you can make contact with your partner - we are hoping that you can share enough about yourselves with each other that trust arises naturally. Maybe you’d let each other know what the most important policies to you, what you would like your vote to achieve, why you have decided to swap your vote; maybe you’ll let each other know when you’re heading down to the ballot and when you’ve voted. We’re hoping that this site will contribute to a greater sense of community amongst voters, all hoping to make the country run as well as possible for a better future.
