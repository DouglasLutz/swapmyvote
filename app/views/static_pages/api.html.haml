    %h1 Swap My Vote API

    %p

      Swap My Vote does not have a conventional REST API, but we do
      have a single end point to pre-populate some of the fields that
      a user can choose.

    %p

      This should be ideal for tactical voting campaigns which want to
      encourage voters to follow their recommendations, and indeed we
      would be very happy to see tactical voting sites integrate with
      Swap My Vote.  The below documentation is probably sufficient,
      but if you need assistance then please

      = link_to("get in touch", contact_path) + "."

    %p

      Available parameters are:

    %dl

      %dt
        %code
          willing_party_name
      %dd
        The party that the user is willing to vote for, say
        tactically.

      %dt
        %code
          preferred_party_name
      %dd
        The party that the user would ideally like to vote for, say if
        all votes counted equally nationally.

    %p

      For example if a tactical voting site wishes to recommend a user
      to vote for the Liberal Democrat candidate in their
      consitituency, they could use this outbound link:

      %pre
        %code
          = link_to(swap_url(willing_party_name: "liberal_democrats"))

    %p

      The party names should be lowercased and use underscores instead
      of spaces. We support 7 parties at the moment, with the follow
      canonical names on Swap My Vote:

    %ul
      %li
        %code labour
      %li
        %code liberal_democrats
      %li
        %code green_party
      %li
        %code conservatives
      %li
        %code ukip
      %li
        %code snp
      %li
        %code plaid_cymru
