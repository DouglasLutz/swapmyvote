    Weâ€™re looking for a voting partner for you.

%p

  At the moment we have more voters who want to vote the same way as
  you, but fewer with complementary preferences.

%h2 While you're waiting ...

- if !@user.phone_verified?

  %h3 Why not verify your phone number?

  %p

    This is required before confirming a swap in order to prove you're
    a genuine account.

  = form_for @user, url: user_path do
    = render partial: 'mobile_phone/form', locals: {mobile_number: @mobile_number}

%h3 Spread the word!

%p

  You can also help us find more potential voting partners by sharing
  Swap My Vote with your friends!
