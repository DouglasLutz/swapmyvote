	Hi #{@user.name},
%p
	You're all set to swap your vote with
	%a{:href => @swap_with.profile_url} #{@swap_with.name}!
	#{@swap_with.name} is going to vote for the #{@swap_with.willing_party.name} party for you, in the #{@swap_with.constituency.name} constituency.
	In return, you will vote for the #{@swap_with.preferred_party.name} party in your constituency (#{@user.constituency.name}).
%p
	We'll send some reminders to #{@swap_with.name} to remind them to vote for your chosen party on June 8th, and we'll ask them for confirmation once they have.
	In the meantime, why not 
	%a{:href => @swap_with.profile_url} reach out to #{@swap_with.name} directly?
%p
	All the best,
	%br
	Swap My Vote Team
