	Hi #{@user.name},
%p
	Good news! #{@swap_with.name} would like to swap their vote with you.
	#{@swap_with.name} is voting in the #{@swap_with.constituency.name} constituency,
	and will vote for the #{@swap_with.willing_party.name} party if you vote for the #{@swap_with.preferred_party.name} party in
	your constituency!
%p
	= link_to "Click here to confirm this swap!", user_url(log_in_with: @user.provider)
%p
	Please confirm this swap as soon as possible. Votes for the #{@swap_with.willing_party.name}
	party are in demand, so if you don't confirm this swap, we may not be able to find you someone else to swap with.
	If we don't get a confirmation in 3 days, we'll have to look for someone else to swap
	#{@swap_with.name}'s vote with.
%p
	Regards,
