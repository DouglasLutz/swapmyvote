  Hi #{@user.name},
%p
  The 2015 General Election polls have just opened, but I'm sorry to say that
  we haven't been able to match you up with some to swap with.
  All is not lost though - you can still vote tactically, or for the party you most wish to support.

  Thank you for taking part - together we are making democracy better and more representative.

  All the best,
